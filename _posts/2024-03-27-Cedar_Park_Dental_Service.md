THIS IS WHAT MODERN DENTISTRY LOOKS LIKE

* They accept without insurance.

Dr. Regina Yunusov

General Dentist & Owner of Cedar Park Dental Welness
Hi, I am Dr. Regina Yunusov, or you can call me Dr. Regina or Regina, or if you like to keep things proper and you can pronounce it, then Dr. Yunusov works as well. As you might have figured, I am the dentist here, and this is my practice.

I love to take exceptional care of my patients, which is why I decided to open up my dental practice here in the heart of beautiful Cedar Park, TX.

Now to the boring stuff. I am an internationally-trained dentist and a graduate of Loma Linda University School of Dentistry, located in Loma Linda, California. My husband and I are raising three small children, and we are proud to call Austin, TX, our home.

Dentistry is not just a profession for me; it is my true passion and way of life.
